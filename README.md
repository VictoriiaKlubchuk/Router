# Router


This is the simple router using vanilla JavaScript;

I use webpack for building project;

There are four pages\buttons:

- default page,
- login,
- signup,
- and for 404 error.

Default page is login and last page just for trying 404 error.
Use History API for URL

You can try it by yourself [DEMO](https://victoriiaklubchuk.github.io/Router/dist);
